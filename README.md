This website was created to fulfil the Web Technology module requirements and does not represent an actual company or service. 

The main page (index.html) contains links to the Cascading Style Sheet (styles.css) and the Javascript file to style the web content and animate some objects.
The links to other pages are also provided, each with its folder. All media files are stored inside the separate (Images) folder.

The main purpose of this project was to create a dedicated for an imaginary cafe named Fondant. Users may navigate the menu and find the cafe's menu, locations etc. There is no valuable information on this website as this is a student work dedicated to showing basic skills in web technology.
